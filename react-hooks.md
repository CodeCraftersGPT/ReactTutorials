# React Hooks

React Hooks are a new feature introduced in React 16.8 that allows you to use state and other React features without writing a class. Hooks are functions that let you "hook into" React state and lifecycle features from function components.

## useState Hook

The `useState` hook is used to add state to functional components. It takes an initial state value as an argument and returns an array with two elements: the current state value and a function to update the state.
